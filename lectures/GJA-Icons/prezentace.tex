\begin{frame}\frametitle{Contents}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Following icons should help you to find most important things in the huge amount of slides and aid better repetition of the theme.
    \item Slides without icons are also important. It is not good idea to skip them. It is better to go through the whole presentation and pay special attention to the slides with the third and later icon. It is possible to go only through important ones in the second pass.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Icons}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Prerequisite slide (should be familiar from previous courses)
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/p}
    \item For orientation -- it is enough to know that something like this exists. It is meaningless to memorize it row by row.
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/kompas}
    \item This should not be overlooked -- some very important information is included
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/oko}
    \item It is necessary to think about it. It is not a good idea to memorize it mechanically
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/zarovka}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Icons}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This should be studied more deeply. It is not necessary to memorize the identifiers exactly, but principles and basic functions are important
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/lupa}
    \item Very important slide - basic concepts, definitions and most important principles included
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/pozor}
    \item It is necessary to try it and understand to the example
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=1cm]{img/naradi}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
